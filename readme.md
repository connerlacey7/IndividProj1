**Project Description**:

**Project Goals**:

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download pytorch
2. Makes ure pandas runs properly
3. Jupyter Notebooks are preferred for machine learning

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open the ipynb file
2. load in the libraries and run the different cells
3. train the model and the test it
4. load in the model.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* pytorch
* pandas
* python

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to see if I can engineer more variables to better fit my model.
* [ ] See how I can incorporate xgboost trees into this model as well
* [ ] I want to solve howto remove certain outliers that are way out there.
